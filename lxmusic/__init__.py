        """Get stream details (playback URL) for a track.

        /api/music/url needs a songInfo object with at least source and
        songmid, and quality is one of flac/320k/128k. A cached raw item is
        passed whole when available, which matches more often.

        The server only falls back between APIs within one platform, it does
        not search other platforms for the song. Cross-platform re-search by
        name is deliberately not done here: same-name hits are often covers,
        remixes or other versions, which plays the wrong recording.

        So this method only:
        1) loops qualities on the original source and lets the server try its
           own custom APIs
        2) health-checks the returned URL, since a broken gateway can still
           answer 200 with an unusable body
        3) gives up when no healthy URL is available, which means the user has
           to enable another working custom source in the lxserver web UI
